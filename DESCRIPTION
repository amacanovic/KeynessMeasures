Description: This package provides alternatives to conventual measures used in
    corpus analysis. Dominant measures provide statistical significance testing
    of the key words in corpora, but not the measures of effect strengths. This
    package incorporates several measures proposed in the literature (log 
    likelihood effect size, %DIFF, relative risk, log ratio and odds ratio). 
    It also offers calculations of the log likelihood and BIC as an alternative 
    measure of statistical significance. It relies on quanteda's functions to 
    obtain and group frequency tables.
